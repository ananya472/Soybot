# Soybot

ChatBot for Soybean Farmers
Developed and deployed an intelligent chatbot tailored for soybean farmers, delivering real-time, context-aware responses to agricultural queries using advanced NLP and LLM integration.

Built using Python, Flask, LangChain, and Hugging Face LLMs, with a domain-specific FAISS vector database to retrieve precise answers from agricultural documents.

Integrated a custom prompt template and optimized language understanding through intent recognition, significantly boosting response relevance and user satisfaction.

Preprocessed and embedded agricultural data using sentence-transformers, ensuring high semantic accuracy and fast retrieval from the knowledge base.

Enhanced the farmer experience by enabling bilingual (Hindi + English) support and reducing irrelevant outputs with context-driven logic.
